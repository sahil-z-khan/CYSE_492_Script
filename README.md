# CYSE 492 Open-Stack Pentesting

Design a penetration testing program for our cloud infrastructure.  The goal for the team will be to familiarize ourselves with OpenStack architecture and its security guide, and draft a pentration testing plan. This repository contains our research along with software/scripts that we've developed over the span of the fall semester.
